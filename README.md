Currently working on swap to the Cryptocompare API, which will allow me to completely remove the 250ms delay between requests and add new stuff.

This is the first time I program in C#, also is the first time that I use Windows Forms and the first time I use GitHub to make a public project, so probably some things could be done in a better way.

Also my english is far from perfect, so expect some grammatical errors if you read the tooltips (by holding the mouse on almost any thing in the settings).
